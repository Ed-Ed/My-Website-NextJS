# [My-Website-NextJS](www.gstared.com)

My portfolio website, simplified, built in TypeScript using NextJS. Hosted on Google App Engine.

## Purpose

NextJS is better in pretty much every way, except it's slower. This project is purely for me to monitor the updates.

## Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/Ed-Ed/My-Website-NextJS.git`

`yarn` or `yarn install`

`yarn dev` to run in dev mode

`yarn build` then `yarn start` to run in production mode
